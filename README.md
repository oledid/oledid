### Hi, I'm Ole Morten ðŸ˜€

I have been working as a full stack web developer since 2010. Before that, I studied game programming at [Hedmark University College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedmark_University_College), where I got a bachelors degree in "Opplevelsesproduksjon og interaktive medier".

After my studies, I have been employed by the following companies:
* [Revio AS](https://www.qondor.com/) (2010-2014)
* [Capitech AS](https://www.simployer.no/) (2014-2019)
* [IKT ORKidÃ©](https://www.iktorkide.no/) (2019-now)

I mainly work with the following technologies:
* [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) and [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and web frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/)
* [Azure SQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/) databases

I also like [powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), [python](https://www.python.org/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and other interesting stuff.

When I'm not working, I'm usually with my family.

In the recent years, some of my work has made the news:
* A way to monitor people who has been infected by covid-19: [TK](https://www.tk.no/kristiansund-forst-i-norge-med-digitalt-koronaverktoy-vil-bidra-til-a-berge-liv/s/5-51-789597) | [VG](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/P9xWzp/hjemmeovervaaker-coronasmittede)
* An application which can open doors: [NRK](https://tv.nrk.no/serie/distriktsnyheter-moere-og-romsdal/201912/DKMR99120219/avspiller#t=2m50s)
